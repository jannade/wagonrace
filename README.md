## Background 

Created a JavaScript game: the Wagon Race üèé in my 4th week at Le Wagon. It's a simple game where you use your keyboard to make a Wagon move forward. Each player will move their Wagon by tapping a key (e.g. `Q` for player one, `P` for player two)

The goal here was to learn more about JavaScript, the DOM, and asynchronous event handling.
